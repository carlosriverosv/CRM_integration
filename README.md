## Problem üìã

In a company X there is a custom-made CRM that its sales agents use in its daily basis. This system is a pipeline where leads could convert into prospects. In order to do that conversion the sales agents have to run manual checks to validate that the person is elegible to be a prospect in the company. The company needs to automate this process.

## Requirement üìã
It is necessary to integrate with other external systems and include the functionality in the CRM in order to let the sales agents to trigger those validations by demand.

Every lead stages with basical personal information. And the critieria to turn sales qualiafied lead into a prospect is to pass various validations with different systems

- The person should exists in the national registry identification (external system)
- The person does not have any judicial records in the national archives (external system)
- Our internal prospect qualification system gives a satisfactory score for that person. This system outputs a random score between 0 and 100. A lead could be turned into prospect if the score is greater than 60 


There are some considerations, the national registry request have to made in parallel with the judicial record requests. And the output have to pass by the internal prospect qualification.
